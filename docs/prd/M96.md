# M96 — Reliability auto-remediation planning contract (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Transform M91 reliability signals into deterministic auto-remediation planning contracts for operator action readiness.

## Scope
- Deterministic remediation-plan suggestion payloads from SLO/drill/replay signals.
- Signed remediation-plan export surface.
- Strict idempotency, scope, and tamper-fail verification.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m96` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M96.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M96/latest/*`.
