# M90 — Cross-adapter cycle semantics and signed receipts (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic cross-adapter cycle semantics and signed receipt contracts for non-atomic cross-ecosystem settlement outcomes.

## Scope
- Add idempotent cross-adapter cycle semantics recording with explicit non-atomicity disclosure acceptance.
- Enforce Tier-2 preflight readiness linkage before semantics can be recorded.
- Add idempotent signed cross-adapter receipt recording tied to settlement receipt signature validity.
- Add deterministic read surface for cycle semantics/receipt projection including signature-valid telemetry.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m90` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M90.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M90/latest/*`.
