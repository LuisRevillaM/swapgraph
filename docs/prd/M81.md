# M81 — Webhook reliability and dead-letter replay hardening (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic webhook reliability controls for milestone M81.

## Scope
- Add delivery-attempt ledger and retry-policy metadata contracts.
- Add signed dead-letter export surface with deterministic pagination/continuation.
- Add idempotent dead-letter replay/backfill workflow.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m81` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M81.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M81/latest/*`.
