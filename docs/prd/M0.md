# M0 — Repo bootstrap + verification harness

## Objective
Create a clean, autopilot-friendly repo scaffold for SwapGraph, and import the v1.3 system plan as the source spec.

This milestone is intentionally **implementation-light**: it’s about establishing the file contracts and proof harness we will use for all later milestones.

## Scope
- Repo structure: `PLAN.md`, `docs/`, `milestones/`, `verify/`, `ops/`.
- Canonical plan source pointer exists at `docs/source/LATEST.md`.
- Versioned plan docs live in `docs/source/` (e.g., `SwapGraph_System_Plan_v2.0_Feb2026.md`).
- A runnable verification script (`npm run verify:m0`) that produces stable artifacts under:
  - `artifacts/milestones/M0/latest/*`

## Non-goals
- No Steam integration.
- No matching engine.
- No UI.

## Acceptance criteria
- `npm run verify:m0` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M0.yaml` exits 0.
- Required artifacts exist:
  - `artifacts/milestones/M0/latest/commands.log`
  - `artifacts/milestones/M0/latest/assertions.json`
- Spec gap log exists: `docs/spec/GAPS.md`

## Notes
- Trade hold/lock policy for MVP defaults to **exclude** per plan v1.3; we can revisit once we know how much liquidity we lose.
