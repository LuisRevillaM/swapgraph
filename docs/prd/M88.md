# M88 — Unified inclusion-proof linkage (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic linkage contracts that unify signed receipts, custody inclusion proofs, and transparency-log publication roots/chains.

## Scope
- Add idempotent inclusion-proof linkage record surface.
- Validate signed receipt integrity, custody inclusion proof derivation/verification, and transparency publication artifact linkage.
- Add signed inclusion-proof linkage export with deterministic pagination, attestation continuity, and checkpoint retention enforcement.
- Add fixture scenario proving idempotency replay/mismatch, linkage validation failures, continuation checks, and tamper-fail verification.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m88` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M88.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M88/latest/*`.
