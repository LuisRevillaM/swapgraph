# M84 — Steam Tier-1 adapter contract hardening (fixture-only)

## Objective
Finalize deterministic Steam Tier-1 adapter contract surfaces for integration handoff while remaining fixture-only.

## Scope
- Add idempotent contract upsert/read surfaces for Steam Tier-1 adapter settings.
- Add idempotent preflight contract checks for settlement mode support, dry-run requirements, and batch-size ceilings.
- Add deterministic fixture harness proving scope enforcement and idempotency behavior.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m84` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M84.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M84/latest/*`.
