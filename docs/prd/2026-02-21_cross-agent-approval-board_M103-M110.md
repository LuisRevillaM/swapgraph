# Cross-agent approval board — M103 to M110 (Liquidity Provider Subsystem)

Date: 2026-02-21
Status: Draft approval board (PRD-only mode)

Purpose: single checklist for cross-agent approval of the LP subsystem PRD tranche before any M103+ implementation starts.

## A) PRD approvals
- [ ] M103 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m103-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M103.md`)
- [ ] M104 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m104-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M104.md`)
- [ ] M105 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m105-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M105.md`)
- [ ] M106 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m106-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M106.md`)
- [ ] M107 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m107-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M107.md`)
- [ ] M108 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m108-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M108.md`)
- [ ] M109 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m109-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M109.md`)
- [ ] M110 closure + PRD approved (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_m110-prd-review-closure.md`, `docs/prd/M110.md`)

## B) Dependency gate
- [ ] M98–M102 approval board complete (`docs/prd/2026-02-21_cross-agent-approval-board_M98-M102.md`)
- [ ] BRD dependencies acknowledged for M109/M110
- [ ] LP execution posture approved (`simulation` / `operator_assisted` / `constrained_auto` default)

## C) Discovery ownership gate
- [ ] Owner assigned for M109 open decisions
- [ ] Owner assigned for M110 user-control/disclosure decisions
- [ ] Review cadence approved

## D) Implementation pause confirmation
- [ ] Explicit statement recorded: M103+ remains PRD-only until approval

## Fast sign-off helper
- Default-decision pack: `docs/prd/2026-02-21_m103-m110-default-decision-pack.md`
- [ ] Default pack accepted as-is, or amendments recorded per milestone decision

## Suggested ownership template

## Approval gate
Only after A+B+C+D are complete should implementation planning for M103+ be considered.
