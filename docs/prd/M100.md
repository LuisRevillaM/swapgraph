# M100 — Metrics and network health contracts (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Convert v2 metrics/network-health section into deterministic, contract-backed API surfaces suitable for partner and operator instrumentation.

## Scope
- Add metrics contracts for:
  - north-star metrics (weekly successful swaps per active trader, fill-rate)
  - marketplace funnel metrics
  - partner/API operational metrics
  - safety/trust metrics
- Add deterministic windowing and aggregation semantics for reproducible fixture outputs.
- Add signed metrics export contract with continuity/tamper-fail verification.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m100` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M100.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M100/latest/*`.
