# M74 — Rollout diagnostics automation rollback plan synthesis anchors (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic signed automation attestation anchors for rollout diagnostics focused on **rollback-plan** behavior.

## Scope
- Extend/verify `automation_hints.execution_attestation` fields related to rollback-plan.
- Ensure export signing binds these fields into attestation consistency checks.
- Add fixture scenario + verifier coverage including resigned tamper detection.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m74` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M74.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M74/latest/*`.
