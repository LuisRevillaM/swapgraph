# M93 — Cross-adapter compensation case contract (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Introduce deterministic compensation-case contracts for cross-adapter discrepancy outcomes produced in M90.

## Scope
- Idempotent compensation-case create/update/read surfaces.
- Deterministic lifecycle states and reason codes (`open`, `approved`, `rejected`, `resolved`).
- Scope-enforced auth and idempotency replay/mismatch coverage.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m93` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M93.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M93/latest/*`.
