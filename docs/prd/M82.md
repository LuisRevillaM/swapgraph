# M82 — Risk tier policy engine contract hardening (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic risk-tier policy contracts and write-path enforcement reason codes for milestone M82.

## Scope
- Add partner risk-tier policy upsert/read contracts.
- Enforce policy controls across mutating partner commercial operations (blocked operations, manual review, hourly write throttles).
- Add deterministic fixture scenario proving enforcement reason codes and replay-safe idempotency behavior.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m82` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M82.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M82/latest/*`.
