# M1 — One platform API (internal dogfood)

## Objective
Convert the v2.0 plan into **canonical, versionable primitives** that are:
- unambiguous,
- machine-validated,
- fixtures-first,
so future milestones can be implemented and verified with high confidence.

This milestone is *not* about Steam integration yet. It is about the **contract**.

## Scope
- Canonical primitives list (`docs/spec/PRIMITIVES.md`).
- JSON Schemas for the v1 primitives under `docs/spec/schemas/`.
- Example payloads under `docs/spec/examples/`.
- Verifier that:
  1) validates every example against its schema, and
  2) emits stable proof artifacts.

## Non-goals
- No real REST server.
- No matching engine.
- No custody/settlement.

## Acceptance criteria
- `npm run verify:m1` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M1.yaml` exits 0.
- Proof artifacts exist at `artifacts/milestones/M1/latest/*`.

## Required artifacts
- `docs/spec/PRIMITIVES.md`
- `docs/spec/IDEMPOTENCY.md`
- `docs/spec/EVENTS.md`
- `docs/spec/ERRORS.md`
- `docs/spec/schemas/*.schema.json`
- `docs/spec/examples/*.example.json`
- `artifacts/milestones/M1/latest/schema_validation.json`
- `artifacts/milestones/M1/latest/commands.log`
