# M92 — Full-plan conformance and release-readiness gate (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Finalize the M71–M92 tranche with a deterministic conformance gate that proves plan coverage, release-readiness assertions, and zero unresolved blockers.

## Scope
- Add release-readiness conformance matrix (`docs/spec/CONFORMANCE.md`) mapping gates G1–G9 to concrete repo artifacts.
- Add deterministic M92 scenario validating milestone artifact presence, conformance/status/gaps tokens, and blockers posture.
- Ensure M92 artifacts are verifier-gated and reproducible via fixture hash.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m92` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M92.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M92/latest/*`.
