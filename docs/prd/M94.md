# M94 — Compensation ledger + signed export (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Add deterministic compensation-ledger accounting and signed export continuity for partner/compliance reconciliation.

## Scope
- Append-only compensation ledger records.
- Signed paginated export with deterministic continuation anchors.
- Tamper-fail signature/hash verification scenarios.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m94` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M94.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M94/latest/*`.
