Produce an updated operator evidence contract/runbook pack for current `main` and staged execution readiness.

## Scope
- Deterministic evidence manifest/checkpoint contract for staging proof bundles.
- Runbook updates for integration-gated flows and conformance evidence capture.
- Verifier-backed proof bundle integrity checks.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m97` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M97.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M97/latest/*`.
