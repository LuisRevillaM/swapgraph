# M95 — Dispute-to-compensation linkage workflow (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Bridge dispute lifecycle (M83) with compensation workflows (M93/M94) through deterministic policy-governed linkage contracts.

## Scope
- Link dispute records to compensation cases/ledger entries.
- Deterministic transition guards and reason-code enforcement.
- Auditable linkage read/export surfaces.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m95` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M95.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M95/latest/*`.
