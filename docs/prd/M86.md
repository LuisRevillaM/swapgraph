# M86 — Steam Vault live proof (integration-gated)

## Objective
Deliver operator-gated live proof capture for Steam Vault settlement lifecycle (deposit/reserve/release/withdraw) with deterministic artifacts.

## Scope
- Add idempotent live-proof record contract for Steam Tier-1 vault settlement outcomes.
- Enforce integration gate (`INTEGRATION_ENABLED=1`) and partner scope requirements (`settlement:write` + `vault:write`).
- Require complete lifecycle evidence (`deposit`, `reserve`, `release`, `withdraw`) and contract compatibility.
- Produce deterministic proof hashes and verifier artifacts for auditability.
- Provide staging runbook with validation, rollback, and incident handling notes.

## Acceptance
- `INTEGRATION_ENABLED=1 npm run verify:m86` exits 0.
- `INTEGRATION_ENABLED=1 node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M86.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M86/latest/*`.
