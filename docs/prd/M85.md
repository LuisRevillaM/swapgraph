# M85 — Steam deposit-per-swap live proof (integration-gated)

## Objective
Deliver operator-gated live proof capture for Steam deposit-per-swap settlement with deterministic, auditable evidence artifacts.

## Scope
- Add idempotent live-proof record contract for Steam Tier-1 deposit-per-swap settlement outcomes.
- Enforce integration gate (`INTEGRATION_ENABLED=1`) and partner write-scope authz.
- Require adapter contract compatibility (deposit-per-swap mode enabled, not dry-run-only).
- Produce deterministic proof hashes and artifact outputs for verifier/runner gates.
- Provide an operator runbook with rollback/escalation notes for staging execution.

## Acceptance
- `INTEGRATION_ENABLED=1 npm run verify:m85` exits 0.
- `INTEGRATION_ENABLED=1 node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M85.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M85/latest/*`.
