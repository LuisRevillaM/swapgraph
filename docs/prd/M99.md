# M99 — Trust & safety risk-signal contracts (PRD-only, implementation-ready)

## Objective
Formalize v2 trust/safety iteration as deterministic contract surfaces for fraud and account-takeover detection and policy decisions.

## Scope
### A) Risk-signal ingestion contracts (to define)
- Fraud signal record operation (e.g., anomaly flags, laundering suspicion indicators).
- Account-takeover indicator record operation (device drift, session anomalies, unusual action velocity).

### B) Policy decision contracts (to define)
- Deterministic trust/safety decision surface with outputs:
  - `allow`
  - `manual_review`
  - `block`
- Decision metadata requirements:
  - reason codes
  - contributing signals
  - confidence/severity indicators
  - correlation + audit trace linkage

### C) Audit/export contracts (to define)
- Signed trust/safety decision export with deterministic continuation and tamper-fail verification.
- Cross-linking hooks into dispute and reliability workflows.

## Contract constraints
- Idempotency required for signal recording and decision writes.
- Stable reason-code taxonomy (no free-form error semantics in response contracts).
- Safety decisions cannot be bypassed by commercial policy layers.

## Non-goals (M99)
- No model-training or heuristic tuning implementation.
- No production fraud model rollout.
- No manual review tooling UI implementation.

## Open decisions to resolve in PRD review
1. Whether trust/safety scopes remain under existing scope families or require dedicated scope namespace.
2. Minimum required signal set for deterministic `manual_review` vs `block` decisions.
3. Retention and redaction policy for exported trust/safety evidence.

## Acceptance (PRD stage)
- M99 PRD is accepted when signal categories, decision reason-code taxonomy, and signed export contract boundaries are explicit and reviewable.

## Acceptance (future implementation stage)
- `npm run verify:m99` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M99.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M99/latest/*`.
