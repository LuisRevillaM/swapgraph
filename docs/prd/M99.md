# M99 — Trust & safety risk-signal contracts (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Formalize v2 trust/safety iteration as deterministic contract surfaces for fraud and account-takeover detection and policy decisions.

## Scope
- Add risk-signal recording contracts for fraud/abuse and account-takeover indicators.
- Add deterministic risk-decision contracts (`allow`, `manual_review`, `block`) with stable reason-code taxonomy.
- Add auditable trust/safety decision log export with signed integrity verification and tamper-fail checks.
- Ensure policy decisions can be linked to downstream dispute and reliability workflows.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m99` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M99.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M99/latest/*`.
