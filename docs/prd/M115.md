# M115 — Bounded exhaustive cycle enumeration (SCC + canonical DFS, deterministic)

## Objective
Upgrade matching cycle discovery from fixed-length (2/3 only) to bounded exhaustive simple-cycle enumeration with deterministic output.

## Scope
- Add bounded cycle discovery API over the compatibility graph:
  - exhaustive simple cycles within `min_cycle_length..max_cycle_length`,
  - SCC decomposition + canonical start-node DFS traversal,
  - deterministic canonicalization and ordering.
- Keep compatibility wrappers for length-2 and length-3 discovery.
- Wire matching engine to bounded discovery defaults (`2..3`) so existing API behavior remains unchanged unless a longer bound is requested by callers.
- Add deterministic verifier coverage proving:
  - `max_cycle_length=3` excludes 4-cycles,
  - `max_cycle_length=4` includes 4-cycles exhaustively,
  - repeated runs with same inputs are byte-for-byte stable.

## Non-goals (M115)
- No selector/optimizer changes (greedy disjoint remains).
- No marketplace API request-shape changes.
- No TS runtime cutover.
