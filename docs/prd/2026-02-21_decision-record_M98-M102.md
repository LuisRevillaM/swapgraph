# Decision record — M98 to M102

Date: 2026-02-21  
Status: Approved and implementation-closed (M98–M102)

Purpose: freeze explicit decision posture for M98–M102 so implementation can proceed without reopening baseline PRD debates.

## Final decision posture

| Milestone | Decision posture | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| M98 | Approved as written | D1–D6 accepted; fixtures-first implementation completed with verifier closure. |
| M99 | Approved as written | D1–D7 accepted; fixtures-first implementation completed with verifier closure. |
| M100 | Approved as written | D1–D7 accepted; fixtures-first implementation completed with verifier closure. |
| M101 | Approved with amendment | D1–D7 accepted; fixtures-first implementation completed with verifier closure; D5 scope-migration gate retained pre-external rollout. |
| M102 | Approved with amendment | D1–D8 accepted; fixtures-first implementation completed with verifier closure; D6 scope-migration gate retained pre-external rollout. |

## Amendments

1. Scope migration gate (M101-D5, M102-D6):
   - Reusing existing scopes is accepted for first implementation tranche.
   - Before external partner rollout, dedicated scope families must be defined, validated, and verified in a follow-on milestone.
   - External rollout cannot rely on indefinite scope overloading.

## Execution order authorization

1. Implementation order approved: `M98 -> M99 -> M100 -> M101 -> M102`.
2. LP subsystem (`M103+`) remains PRD-approved but implementation-deferred until M98–M102 implementation + verification closure is complete.
