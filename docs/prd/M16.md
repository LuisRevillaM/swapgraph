# M16 — Partner scoping (multi-tenant) for settlement reads

## Objective
Introduce **partner scoping** for multi-tenant safety: a partner should only be able to read cycles that are owned by that partner.

This milestone is still fixtures-first and does **not** implement real partner auth or user/partner mapping — it adds the minimum durable linkage in state needed to prove the contract.

## New primitive (internal state)
- `store.state.tenancy.cycles[cycle_id] = { partner_id }`

This is set when settlement starts (first time we create a timeline), and used to authorize partner reads.

## Rules (v1)
- Partner reads require:
  - `cycle_partner_id` exists in tenancy state, and
  - `cycle_partner_id === actor.id`
- If missing or mismatched → `FORBIDDEN`.

User participant reads are unchanged (still allowed if participant).

## Acceptance criteria
- `npm run verify:m16` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.mjs milestones/M16.yaml` exits 0.
