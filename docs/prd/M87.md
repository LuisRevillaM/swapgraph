# M87 — Transparency log publication contract (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic append-only transparency-log publication contracts linking settlement receipts and governance artifacts.

## Scope
- Add idempotent transparency publication record contract with root-chain continuity checks.
- Add signed transparency publication export with deterministic pagination, attestation continuity, and checkpoint retention enforcement.
- Add fixture scenario proving idempotency replay/mismatch, root-chain mismatch rejection, export continuation, and tamper-fail verification.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m87` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M87.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M87/latest/*`.
