# M87 — Transparency log publication contract (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver append-only transparency log publication and signed export contracts linking settlement receipts and governance artifacts.

## Scope
- Add idempotent publication append API contract for transparency log entries.
- Add signed, paginated transparency log export with deterministic attestation/checkpoint continuation.
- Add verifier-grade payload verification and tamper-fail proofs (export hash, attestation/checkpoint chain, signature).

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m87` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M87.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M87/latest/*`.
