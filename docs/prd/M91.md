# M91 — Reliability/SLO conformance pack (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic reliability conformance contracts covering SLO windows, incident-drill evidence, and replay/recovery robustness verification.

## Scope
- Add idempotent SLO metric recording contract (availability, latency, and error-budget windows).
- Add idempotent incident-drill evidence recording contract (severity, runbook, evidence refs, recovery target checks).
- Add idempotent replay-check recording contract (event-log hash parity + state-hash recovery parity).
- Add signed reliability conformance export contract summarizing pass/fail posture across all reliability dimensions.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m91` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M91.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M91/latest/*`.
