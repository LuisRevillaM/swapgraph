# M101 — Product-surface readiness contracts (discovery-first + fixtures-first)

## Objective
Define the contract layer required by web marketplace, iOS reference client, and embedded partner UI so official client-side development has a stable API target.

## Scope
- Define notification taxonomy + preference contracts (including quiet-hours/urgency controls) aligned to v2 client requirements.
- Define product projection contracts for:
  - inventory awakening
  - cycle inbox proposal cards
  - settlement timeline digest
  - receipt share-card metadata
- Define embedded partner UI payload contracts for composable component rendering.
- Keep scope contract-first; no requirement to implement full client UI in this milestone.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m101` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M101.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M101/latest/*`.
