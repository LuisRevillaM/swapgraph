# M101 — Product-surface readiness contracts (PRD-only, discovery-first)

## Objective
Define the API contract layer required by web marketplace, iOS reference client, and embedded partner UI so official client-side development has stable targets.

## Scope
### A) Notification and preference contracts (to define)
- Notification event taxonomy aligned to v2 client flows:
  - proposal lifecycle
  - settlement lifecycle
  - failure/refund trust-preserving notifications
  - demand-signal notifications (opt-in)
- User preference controls:
  - quiet hours
  - urgency threshold
  - category-level opt-in/out

### B) Product projection contracts (to define)
- Inventory awakening payload projection.
- Cycle inbox proposal card projection (give/get/explainability/confidence/deadline summary).
- Settlement timeline digest projection.
- Receipt share-card metadata projection (privacy toggles).

### C) Embedded partner UI payload contracts (to define)
- Composable payload schema set for:
  - intent composer
  - proposal cards
  - settlement checklist
  - receipt renderer

## Non-goals (M101)
- No web marketplace implementation.
- No iOS client implementation.
- No embedded SDK implementation.

## Discovery questions to resolve
1. Minimum cross-surface payload contract set to avoid duplicative client-specific endpoints.
2. Notification suppression/priority policy defaults that satisfy UX and anti-spam constraints.
3. Stable contract boundaries between API-only mode and UI-embedded mode.

## Acceptance (PRD stage)
- M101 PRD is accepted when all discovery questions have explicit decisions (or approved deferrals), and contract inventory for client-readiness is complete.

## Acceptance (future implementation stage)
- `npm run verify:m101` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M101.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M101/latest/*`.
