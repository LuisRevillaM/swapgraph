# M98 — API + event surface completion contracts (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Close remaining v2 illustrative API/event coverage gaps as explicit, deterministic contracts before new feature expansion.

## Scope
- Add canonical API contracts for remaining core surfaces highlighted in v2 section 11:
  - `platform-connections`
  - `inventory snapshots/assets`
  - canonical disputes facade (aligned with existing dispute lifecycle contracts)
- Add missing event contract coverage for:
  - `proposal.cancelled`
  - `cycle.failed`
  - `user.reliability_changed`
- Add schemas/examples/manifests and verifier scenario coverage for the new operations/event payloads.
- Preserve idempotency, auth scope discipline, and deterministic error reason codes.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m98` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M98.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M98/latest/*`.
