# M102 — Commercial packaging and policy contracts (PRD-only, discovery-first)

## Objective
Codify v2 monetization and packaging model into explicit contracts while preserving non-bypass trust/safety invariants.

## Scope
### A) Commercial policy contract set (to define)
- Transaction-fee policy objects (base fee + tiered modifiers).
- Subscription tier/cap policy objects.
- Boost/priority policy objects with fairness guardrails.
- Partner quota/overage policy objects and billing context fields.

### B) Invariant contracts (to define)
- Commercial policy cannot bypass trust/risk gates.
- Subscription upgrades cannot auto-unlock unsafe limits.
- Boosting cannot violate matching constraints or settlement safety policy.

### C) Audit/export contracts (to define)
- Signed packaging/policy export surfaces for partner/operator review.
- Deterministic reason codes for policy enforcement outcomes.

## Non-goals (M102)
- No payment gateway implementation.
- No StoreKit entitlement implementation.
- No production pricing rollout.

## Discovery questions to resolve
1. Canonical policy precedence order (safety > trust > commercial > preference).
2. First release contract boundaries for partner-visible pricing internals.
3. Mobile policy constraints for App Store compliance (contract-level notes only at this stage).

## Acceptance (PRD stage)
- M102 PRD is accepted when commercial objects, non-bypass invariants, and audit/export boundaries are explicit and approved.

## Acceptance (future implementation stage)
- `npm run verify:m102` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M102.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M102/latest/*`.
