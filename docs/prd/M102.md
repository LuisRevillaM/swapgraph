# M102 — Commercial packaging and policy contracts (discovery-first + fixtures-first)

## Objective
Codify v2 monetization and packaging model into explicit contracts while preserving safety/risk guardrail invariants.

## Scope
- Define contract objects for pricing/packaging layers:
  - transaction-fee policy
  - subscription tiers/caps
  - boost/priority matching controls
  - quota/overage policy
- Add deterministic guardrails proving commercial settings cannot bypass trust/risk/safety constraints.
- Add signed billing/packaging policy export surfaces for partner/operator auditability.
- Include mobile monetization compatibility notes as contract constraints (no unsafe in-app entitlement shortcuts).

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m102` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M102.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/milestones/M102/latest/*`.
