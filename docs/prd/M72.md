# M72 — Rollout diagnostics automation execution receipt contract (fixtures-first)

## Objective
Deliver deterministic signed automation attestation anchors for rollout diagnostics focused on **execution-receipt** behavior.

## Scope
- Extend/verify `automation_hints.execution_attestation` fields related to execution-receipt.
- Ensure export signing binds these fields into attestation consistency checks.
- Add fixture scenario + verifier coverage including resigned tamper detection.

## Acceptance
- `npm run verify:m72` exits 0.
- `node verify/runner.ts milestones/M72.yaml` returns `overall=true`.
- Artifacts available under `artifacts/milestones/M72/latest/*`.
