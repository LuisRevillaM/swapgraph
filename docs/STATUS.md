## Next
- Current mode: matching performance + TS migration tranche M115–M130 is verifier-complete with v2 full-primary runtime, rollback/fallback controls, concrete TS matching-core modules, runtime TS shadow telemetry, service-level helper decomposition parity, TS service wrapper-removal compatibility gating, matcher-runner seam extraction, and canary/rollback helper extraction.
- Immediate target: M131 TypeScript service migration phase 9 (request/asset normalization helper extraction with parity gate, non-breaking).
- Follow-on contract decision: M120.1 optional global rollback shadow suppression toggle (`MATCHING_V2_ROLLBACK_SUPPRESS_SHADOW`, default `0`) with canary-mode proof.
- TypeScript track (parallel, non-breaking): continue replacing `src-ts` wrappers module-by-module with concrete TS implementations behind parity gates.
- Runtime shell available for request/response validation: `npm run start:api` (`src/server/runtimeApiServer.mjs`).
- CI baseline gate added: `.github/workflows/verify-baseline.yml` (includes `verify:m0`, baseline tranche, `verify:m98`, `verify:m99`, `verify:m100`, `verify:m101`, `verify:m102`, `verify:m103`, `verify:m104`, `verify:m105`, `verify:m106`, `verify:m107`, `verify:m108`, `verify:m109`, `verify:m110`, `verify:m111`, and `verify:m112`).

## Notes
- We are intentionally building *fixtures-first* so verifiers are deterministic and do not require credentials.
- Real Steam settlement milestones are operator-gated integration milestones (`INTEGRATION_ENABLED=1`).
